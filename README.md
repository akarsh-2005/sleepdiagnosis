**AI-powered sleep analysis through environment optimization & snore detection with enhanced MP3 support**

SleepDiagnosis is a comprehensive sleep analysis system that combines advanced audio processing, computer vision, and machine learning to provide personalized sleep health insights. Features **automatic MP3 conversion** for optimal spectrogram generation and superior diagnostic accuracy.

## 🌟 **Enhanced Features**

### 🎵 **Auto MP3 Conversion**
- **Automatic Conversion**: Auto-recorded audio converted to MP3 for optimal analysis
- **Enhanced Quality**: 22.05kHz sample rate, 16-bit depth, mono channel
- **Real-time Processing**: Conversion happens immediately after recording
- **Superior Spectrograms**: 2x higher resolution (4096-point FFT)
- **Medical-Grade Analysis**: Optimized for sleep apnea detection

### Sleep Space Analysis
- Upload bedroom photos for AI-powered environment analysis
- Get personalized recommendations for optimal sleep conditions
- Color-coded severity levels (high, moderate, low)
- Professional sleep environment advice

### Auto Record Snoring
- Real-time snoring detection and automatic recording
- Configurable sensitivity settings (10-90%)
- Customizable recording duration (5 minutes to 2 hours)
- Live audio level monitoring with visual feedback
- Smart snoring event counting

### Upload Audio Analysis
- Support for .wav, .mp3, .m4a, and .flac files
- Advanced spectrogram generation and visualization
- Frequency band analysis (Low, Mid, High frequency ranges)
- Dominant frequency detection
- Sleep apnea probability scoring

### Advanced Analytics
- **Spectrogram Visualization**: Time-frequency analysis with matplotlib
- **Frequency Band Breakdown**: 
  - Low Frequency (0-100 Hz): Deep breathing, body movements
  - Mid Frequency (100-500 Hz): Primary snoring range
  - High Frequency (>500 Hz): Airway turbulence, apnea events
- **Medical Interpretation**: AI-powered insights for sleep patterns
- **Confidence Scoring**: Probability-based sleep apnea detection

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python
- **ML Model**: Audio feature extraction using librosa + scikit-learn

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:9002`

## API Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `POST /analyze` - Audio analysis endpoint

## Usage

1. Open the web interface at `http://localhost:9002`
2. Either record new audio or upload an existing file
3. Click \"Analyze Snore Audio\" to process the recording
4. View the results with confidence scores and recommendations
